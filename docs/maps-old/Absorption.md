## Review

A stylish map with large curved walls and plenty of open room for freestyle running. Which means that there are several shortcuts to explore.

## Notes & Strategies

- The floor in the first room has a special surface pattern that slows you down, so jump and boost to get moving.
- Inspect your environment and be creative. You may find alternate and faster routes.
