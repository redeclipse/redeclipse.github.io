## Buffs
<img src="images/icons/buff.png" width="64px"/>

A buff is a strong, temporary status enhancement that players can receive in capture, bomber or defend games. The buff implies.

- *+25%* attack (outgoing damage is multiplied by 1.25)
- *+25%* defense (incoming damage is divided by 1.25)
- *+50%* health (regenerates up to 150 hp)
- *+40%* faster regeneration (7 hp per second)

Players get buffed when **defending**

- a secured control point in defend games
- their base in bomber games
- the flag in their team base or
- a team mate who carries their flag
- Note: The flag carrier is not buffed and
- dropped flags have no buffing power

## Ailments
Some weapons induce status ailments that inflict some damage over time and last for about five seconds. Useful to delay enemy health recovery. Multiple effects can be stacked.
