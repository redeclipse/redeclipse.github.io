## Overview
Trespass is a clean, postmodern map with single pickups tuned for duel. It has areas that benefit every type of weapon, as well as grenades and mines to utilize.

It was originally released in 2013, but was not compatible with the gameplay style. It has been redone for its inclusion in Red Eclipse.


## Notes & Strategies

- The north side of the map is more cluttered than the open south side. Those who opt not to carry a long range weapon should consider attempting to draw conflict on the north side
- The long corridor on the west side has multiple escape oppertunities out the windows as well as down the ramp if you are under fire.
- The submachine gun pickup is quite vulnerable near the middle of the map on the floor. Defending this pickup and cutting off the opponent's ammo resupply if they carry the SMG may be a viable tactic.
- Flamer users will need to contend with their pickup being in the most vulnerable part of the map.
