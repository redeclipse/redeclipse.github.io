|:-----------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="../images/modes/demo.png" width="64px"/>| [Demo](Demo)| View recorded matches.                                                                                                                                                                  | <img src="../images/modes/editing.png" width="64px"/>| ~~[Editing](Editing-Basics)~~| Make your own custom maps. See ~~[Mapping Tips](Editing-Basics)~~.|
| <img src="../images/modes/deathmatch.png" width="64px"/>| [Deathmatch](Deathmatch)| Kill other players to score points using the [scoring system](Scoring-System). The player or team with the most points at the end wins!|
| <img src="../images/modes/capture.png" width="64px"/>    | [Capture the Flag](Capture-the-Flag)| Steal the other team's flag and return it to your base, without letting them take yours, to score points. Players that defend or escort their, flag benefit from a powerful [buff](Status-Effects), but not the flag carrier, who will move 10% slower.|
| <img src="../images/modes/defend.png" width="64px"/>| ~~[Defend and Control](Defend-and-Control)~~| Stand near control points to secure them. Each control point you hold brings in a steady stream of points. While defending a secured control, point players receive a powerful [buff](Status-Effects). Before enemy control points can be secured, they are overthrown to a neutral state.|
| <img src="../images/modes/bomber.png" width="64px"/>| [Bomber Ball](Bomber-Ball)| Grab the ball and deliver to the enemy base to score, but watch your bomb timer - it will explode if you hold on to it too long. Pass it to your teammates (with the F key) to keep it going. If the other team holds it, kill the carrier or intercept it midair. Players defending their base get [buffed](Status-Effects). |
| <img src="../images/modes/race.png" width="64px"/>| [Race](Race)| Compete in a race for the most number of laps, carefully managing your limited impulse and executing various [parkour moves](Parkour-Guide).|

## Mutators

|                        Icon                          | Name      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:----------------------------------------------------:|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="../images/modes/ffa.png" width="64px"/>       | FFA       | There are no teams, just every player for themselves in a free-for-all showdown. (Not available in CTF, DTF or Gauntlet and in Bomber Ball it implies the *Hold* mutator)                                                                        |
| <img src="../images/modes/coop.png" width="64px"/>      | Coop      | All human players are forced onto the same team, battling against a team of bots ... and there are more of them than there are of you.                                                                                                           |
| <img src="../images/modes/instagib.png" width="64px"/>  | Instagib  | Players spawn with 1 HP, so any hit is lethal. Unless the *Medieval* or *Kaboom* mutators are also selected, players only spawn with the rifle. All rifle spawns on the map become grenade spawns.                                               |
| <img src="../images/modes/medieval.png" width="64px"/>  | Medieval  | Players only have swords for weapons. All sword spawns on the map become grenade spawns.                                                                                                                                                         |
| <img src="../images/modes/kaboom.png" width="64px"/>    | Kaboom    | Players only have grenades and mines for weapons. Grenades and mines reload in this mutator like a normal loadout weapon, though your carry capacity remains default.                                                                            |
| <img src="../images/modes/duel.png" width="64px"/>      | Duel      | Only two players spawn at a time. Other players spectate the two fighting and wait their turn in line before playing again. Winner respawns the next round, loser goes to the back of the line. Beat your opponents the most to win the match.   |
| <img src="../images/modes/survivor.png" width="64px"/>  | Survivor  | All players spawn as normal, but there is no health regeneration. The last player or team standing wins the round. Players that die are placed in a queue to respawn in the next round.                                                          |
| <img src="../images/modes/classic.png" width="64px"/>   | Classic   | Instead of having a menu to select your weapons from, you spawn with only a pistol. The rest of the weapons can be found on the ground, scattered across the map.                                                                                |
| <img src="../images/modes/onslaught.png" width="64px"/> | Onslaught | Enemy drones and sentry turrets spawn in the maps while you fight against other players. If one of them kills you, you lose points!                                                                                                              |
| <img src="../images/modes/freestyle.png" width="64px"/> | Freestyle | Disables all impulse costs and the impulse count rule, so players can do unlimited parkour without even touching ground.                                                                                                                         |
| <img src="../images/modes/vampire.png" width="64px"/>   | Vampire   | Dealing damage to opponents causes you to regain your own health. The default cap in this mutator is 300 health.                                                                                                                                 |
| <img src="../images/modes/resize.png" width="64px"/>    | Resize    | As your health decreases, you get smaller and start slowing down and the converse is true for gaining health. If combined with instagib, instead you get bigger every time you kill someone, until getting killed takes you back to normal size. |
| <img src="../images/modes/hard.png" width="64px"/>      | Hard      | No regeneration and radar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| <img src="../images/modes/basic.png" width="64px"/>     | Basic     | No collectible items will spawn in the arena.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|:------------------------------------------------------:|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
