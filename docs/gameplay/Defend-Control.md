### Tips & strategy

-   Being close to a captured base provides a powerful buff that enhances attack, defense, health regeneration and max health.
-   Try not to over reach your teams bounds, capture the opposite sides base may seem tempting but will usually end with a few bases be over taken as your forces will be spread to thin.

### Mode-specific mutators

| Icon | Mutator | Description |
|-|-|-|
| <img src="images/modes/defendquick.png" width="64px"/> | **Quick** |  When capturing enemy points, they change directly to your color, instead of passing through a neutral "overthrown" state first. |
| <img src="images/modes/defendking.png" width="64px"/>  | **King** | One base, gain points by holding the base. |
