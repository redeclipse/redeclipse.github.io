| <img src="../images/modes/race.png" width="64px"/>| Compete for the fastest time completing a lap. The number of laps does not matter.

### Tips & strategy

-   Attempt to complete the course as quickly as possible, however don't rush and get killed by a trap as there is a somewhat large respawn timer.
-   Turn the player opacity down in settings so your view is not obstructed, you are able to travel through player in this mode.

### Mode-specific mutators

| Icon | Mutator | Description |
|-|-|-|
| <img src="../images/modes/racelapped.png" width="64px"/>     | **Lapped**     | Compete in a race for the most number of laps, carefully managing your limited impulse and executing various [parkour moves](Parkour-Guide).                                     |
| <img src="../images/modes/raceendurance.png" width="64px"/> | **Endurance** | Disables impulse restoration on checkpoints and when respawning. Also slows down impulse recovery, so plan your route carefully.                                                            |
| <img src="../images/modes/racegauntlet.png" width="64px"/>  | **Gauntlet**  | One team (blue/Alpha) races to reach the goal and score points, while the other team (red/Omega) tries to shoot them before they can get there. Teams switch off halfway through the match. |
