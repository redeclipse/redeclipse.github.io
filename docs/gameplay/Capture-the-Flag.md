### Tips & strategy

-   Being close to your team flag provides a powerful buff that enhances attack, defense, health regeneration and max health.
-   A buff is also applied when carrying either your own flag, or the enemy flag.
-   You can retrieve your own flag from the spawn area by pressing **F**, making capture for enemies more difficult.
-   Press **F** to throw away any flags in your possession, or to pass the flag to teammates.
-   You cannot capture the opposing team's flag when your teams flag is not at any base.
