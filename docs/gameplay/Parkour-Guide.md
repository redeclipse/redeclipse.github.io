*Red Eclipse* features a parkour system, that allows you to navigate maps in many different ways.

### The impulse system

Parkour is limited to 6 successive moves in a row by default. Touching the ground will start charging the impulse move count. You can strategically use this to hop / slide / vault / wall run / dash around a map and gain momentum to speed past your opponents.

You can show your current move count on the HUD by checking
-   ***Settings > User Interface > Show Moves Remaining***

or alternatively by opening the in-game console and typing `/showmovecount 1`

### Abilities

| Name                  | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Jump**              | The most simple way to move about, press **[SPACE]** to jump |
| **Impulse Jump**      | Pressing **[SPACE]** a second time after jumping will allow you to double jump. You can also use this to jump sideways. |
| **Wall run**          | Pressing **[Q]** whilst running towards a wall, will place you into a wall run. Tapping **[Q]** whilst you are already in a wall run, will allow you to gain speed. Be cautious of the move counts, as once you run out of moves you will also stop wall running. |
| **Wall climb**        | If you face a vertical wall straight-on and press **[Q]**, you will run vertically upwards. It usually helps to aim upwards when using this. |
| **Slide**             | Holding **[SHIFT]** just as you land on the ground will put you into a slide, you can use this to gain speed whilst moving around the map. Sliding into other players will perform a melee attack. You can also exploit this mechanic to slide through gaps that you wouldn't otherwise be able to walk under. Aiming upwards and jumping at the end of a slide can allow you to jump higher. |
| **Vault**             | Pressing **[Q]** whilst running towards a low obstacle (such as a small wall) will cause the player to quickly hop over the obstacle. You can move about much faster using this in succession. |
| **Dash** (\*)           | Dashing can be used to quickly move out of the way, or to help gain speed whilst moving about the map. Pressing **[F]** will perform a dash, but you can also double tap the **[W]**,**[A]**,**[S]**,**[D]** keys to dash in a specific direction |
| **Impulse Pound** (\*) | After jumping, pressing **[SHIFT]** + **[SPACE]** will make you boost vertically downwards. This can be used to quickly change direction of free-fall movement. This ability can also be used to deal melee damage to a player from above. |
